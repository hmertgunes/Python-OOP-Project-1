# Python-OOP-Project-1

I wrote this project while I was studying OOP with "Advanced Python: Python OOP with 10 Real-World Programs" course.

In general, program creates a rectangle with random size and coordinates then user sees that features. 
User defines a point with it's coordinates and guesses area of rectangle which given above.
Program draws rectangle and point on the screen and shows to user that point falls in rectangle or not.
